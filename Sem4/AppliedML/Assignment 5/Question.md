## Transfer Learning for Image Data using CNN

- **Objective:**  
  Fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify images of ducks vs chickens.

- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Collection:**  
     - Download approximately 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet.
  2. **Environment:**  
     - Use a Google Colab notebook for your implementation.
  3. **Model Fine-Tuning:**  
     - Choose a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet) and fine-tune it on your custom dataset.
  4. **Evaluation:**  
     - Output and print the classification report to show the performance of your model.

## Transfer Learning for Text Data using Transformer

- **Objective:**  
  Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify text sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model.

- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Collection:**  
     - Download the sentiment analysis dataset from [Kaggle: Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset).
  2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**  
     - Use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and fine-tune it on the sentiment analysis dataset.
  3. **Evaluation:**  
     - Print the classification report showing the performance of your sentiment classifier, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class (positive, neutral, negative).
